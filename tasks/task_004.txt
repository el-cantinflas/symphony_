# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Electron UI for Configuration and Log Monitoring
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop Electron desktop UI for configuring endpoints and monitoring logs. Save user inputs to SQLite and display recent logs.
# Details:
Use Electron (latest, e.g., 28.x) with React (latest, e.g., 18.x) or vanilla JS for UI. Build configuration screen with fields: Orderwise API Base URL, External Webhook URL, Bearer Token. Add buttons: Test Orderwise, Send Test Payload, Sync Now. Implement log viewer to display recent sync attempts with timestamps and statuses. Save user inputs to SQLite config table. Use sqlite3 npm package for DB access from UI. Ensure responsive layout for 800x600 resolution with system font and clear spacing.

# Test Strategy:
Test UI input and save to SQLite. Validate log display and button actions. Check UI responsiveness and layout.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Electron Application Scaffolding [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic Electron application structure including main and renderer processes, project dependencies, and initial build configuration.
### Details:
Initialize the Electron project with necessary files such as main.js for the main process and index.html for the renderer. Configure package.json scripts for development and packaging. Establish the multi-process architecture typical of Electron apps to separate UI rendering and backend logic.

## 2. Configuration Screen UI Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the user interface for the configuration screen where users can input and modify settings.
### Details:
Design and implement interactive UI components for configuration using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Ensure the UI communicates with the main process for saving and retrieving configuration data.

## 3. Log Viewer Component Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a component within the UI to display application logs with features like filtering and scrolling.
### Details:
Implement a log viewer in the renderer process that can receive log data from the main process or backend. Include UI elements for viewing extensive verbose logs and support for real-time updates.

## 4. SQLite Integration for Config Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Integrate SQLite database to persist configuration settings and enable data retrieval.
### Details:
Set up SQLite in the Electron main process or a dedicated backend process. Implement methods to save, update, and fetch configuration data from the database, ensuring synchronization with the configuration UI.

## 5. Test Functionality Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Develop and integrate test features to verify application components and workflows.
### Details:
Implement test routines that can be triggered from the UI or background processes to validate configuration settings, log capturing, and database operations. Include automated and manual test capabilities.

## 6. UI Styling and Responsive Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Apply styling and ensure the UI is responsive across different screen sizes and resolutions.
### Details:
Use CSS and possibly frameworks to style the configuration screen and log viewer components. Implement responsive design principles to maintain usability on various desktop window sizes.

## 7. Create and Run Evals, Extensive Verbose Logs, and Testing Software [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.5
### Description: Develop evaluation scripts and testing software to generate verbose logs and verify the overall application functionality.
### Details:
Build tools and scripts to run evaluations that produce detailed logs for debugging and performance analysis. Use these logs to test and verify that all components, including UI, database, and test functionalities, work correctly together.
