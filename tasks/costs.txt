Self-improving final prompt: `Begin development of the assigned sub-task as detailed in [`tasks/tasks.json`](tasks/tasks.json:0). During previous work on this project, a critical issue involving a `better-sqlite3` native module compilation error for Electron was resolved; this was addressed by implementing a specific `postinstall` script in [`package.json`](package.json:10): `\"electron-rebuild -v $(node -p \\\"require('electron/package.json').version\\\") -f -w better-sqlite3\"`. Future agents encountering native module compilation or loading errors should first verify this `postinstall` script's integrity and successful execution during `npm install`. For context, previous database schema verifications (if applicable to your current task) were done by temporarily modifying relevant source files (e.g., [`src/DBManager.js`](src/DBManager.js:0), [`src/index.js`](src/index.js:0)) to run and log `PRAGMA table_info` queries, with those temporary changes subsequently reverted. After completing your assigned sub-task's objectives, ensure all relevant project files (including any necessary changes to [`package.json`](package.json:0) or other configuration files) are correctly tracked by git. For the completion of *this current* set of instructions, do *not* update the main [`tasks/tasks.json`](tasks/tasks.json:0) file to mark the sub-task as complete (this will be handled separately or by a different process). For the next agent working on this project, please review the steps taken and context provided (particularly the `better-sqlite3` resolution and the `postinstall` script), and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes.`

Self-improvement final prompt: "Begin development of the assigned sub-task as detailed in tasks/tasks.json. During previous work on this project (specifically sub-task 2.1: "Windows Service Framework Selection and Setup"), node-windows was selected and installed as the Windows service framework, and integrated into src/service.js with basic service event handlers and command-line flags for installation/uninstallation; corresponding npm scripts (service:install, service:uninstall, service:start, service:stop, service:restart) were added to package.json for lifecycle management. A critical issue involving a better-sqlite3 native module compilation error for Electron was previously resolved by implementing a specific postinstall script in package.json: \"electron-rebuild -v $(node -p \\\"require('electron/package.json').version\\\") -f -w better-sqlite3\"; future agents encountering native module compilation or loading errors, particularly when the service interacts with better-sqlite3, should first verify this postinstall script's integrity and consider if similar rebuild steps are necessary for the service's Node.js environment, which might differ from Electron's. Also, be mindful that the Windows service will run under a specific user account, which could affect permissions for accessing the SQLite database located at Database/database.sqlite, and that logging for very early service lifecycle events (e.g., initial installation before the database is confirmed ready) might require alternative strategies if the primary SQLite logging fails. For context, previous database schema verifications were done by temporarily modifying relevant source files to run and log PRAGMA table_info queries, with those temporary changes subsequently reverted.

During the implementation of sub-task 2.2, [`src/service.js`](src/service.js:1) was further enhanced with detailed comments on `node-windows` lifecycle management, clarifying that `start` and `stop` are handled via script execution and termination signals (SIGTERM/SIGINT) respectively, and that `node-windows` does not provide direct `pause`/`continue` handlers, necessitating application-level solutions if such behavior is required; console logs were also added for clearer operational tracing in `initService` and `stopService`. It's also important to remember that any asynchronous operations (like `setInterval`) started during service initialization should be properly cleaned up or managed during the stop sequence to ensure a graceful shutdown, although the current heartbeat interval terminates with the process. Previous database schema verifications were done by temporarily modifying relevant source files to run and log `PRAGMA table_info` queries, with those temporary changes subsequently reverted.

Key considerations moving forward include Windows service user account permissions for the SQLite database at Database/database.sqlite, the potential need for fallbacks for early service lifecycle logging (though a try-catch exists in src/service.js), the fact that node-windows handles start/stop via script execution and termination signals (requiring application-level solutions for pause/continue and ensuring asynchronous operations like setInterval are cleaned up on stop), the centrality of the LOG_LEVELS constant and currentLogLevel config key to logging behavior, and that the schema update in DBManager.js for logging levels used a simple ALTER TABLE approach. The completion of the documentation task (2.6) highlighted the importance of precise task definitions in tasks/tasks.json to prevent ambiguity and confirmed the value of detailed contextual information in prompts for efficient task execution.

More recently, for sub-task 3.1, an HTTP client was set up in src/ApiClient.js using axios and axios-retry, featuring exponential backoff (specifically, retryCount * 1000ms), retry conditions for network/5xx errors, and integration with addLogEntry from src/DBManager.js for logging retry attempts (WARNING) and final failures (ERROR), with a hardcoded default timeout of 10 seconds. Key considerations moving forward include Windows service user account permissions for the SQLite database at Database/database.sqlite, the potential need for fallbacks for early service lifecycle logging, ensuring robust cleanup of asynchronous operations like setInterval on service stop, the centrality of LOG_LEVELS and currentLogLevel to logging behavior, and the simple ALTER TABLE approach used for schema updates in DBManager.js. The successful, well-scoped completion of sub-task 3.1 by first checking dependencies in package.json, installing them if necessary, and then creating the new module (src/ApiClient.js) with integrated logging using existing functionalities from src/DBManager.js reinforces the effectiveness of clear, iterative steps and leveraging established project components. With this context, proceed with sub-task 3.2, and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes."

SIP: "Begin development of the assigned sub-task (3.2: Configuration Management with SQLite Integration) as detailed in tasks/tasks.json and detailed in tasks/task_003.txt. During previous work on this project, src/DBManager.js was established as the central module for SQLite interactions, including a config table with getConfigValue() and setConfigValue() functions, and a robust logging system with addLogEntry() and LOG_LEVELS. This module was already used for managing configurations like heartbeatIntervalMs and currentLogLevel. Additionally, src/ApiClient.js was created in sub-task 3.1 with axios and axios-retry, featuring exponential backoff and logging integration with DBManager.js, but initially used hardcoded timeout and retry parameters. For the current sub-task 3.2, I built upon this foundation by enhancing src/DBManager.js to include default API configuration keys (e.g., api.orderwise.baseUrl, api.client.timeoutMs), a deleteConfigValue() function, and a new getApiConfig() function. This function retrieves, defaults, and validates API configurations from the SQLite config table. Subsequently, I refactored src/ApiClient.js to use getApiConfig(), making its timeout and retry settings database-driven. This work successfully centralized API client configuration, aligning with the project's existing patterns of using src/DBManager.js for configuration and iterative development. Key considerations from the broader project context that remain relevant include Windows service user account permissions for the SQLite database (Database/database.sqlite), the simple ALTER TABLE approach for schema updates in src/DBManager.js, and the importance of leveraging established components for consistency and efficiency, as demonstrated by the successful completion of both sub-task 3.1 and 3.2. My suggestions for further improvements include: (1) For tasks involving sensitive data, prompts should specify the expected security measures for the current scope. (2) For more complex future schema changes, consider a dedicated migration library. (3) Consumers of ApiClient.js or direct API callers should use getApiConfig() to retrieve baseUrl and bearerToken for constructing requests and adding authorization headers. (4) Reinforce getApiConfig() in DBManager.js as the single source of truth for API configuration. (5) Remember to test database interactions under the actual Windows service account. (6) Maintaining detailed context in prompts and well-defined sub-tasks, as currently practiced, is highly effective. And suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes."

For sub-task 3.3, a mock API server (src/mockApiServer.js) was implemented using Express.js (listening on port 3001, runnable with npm run mock:api) providing endpoints like /mock/orderwise/v1/items and /mock/external-webhook/event to simulate API interactions; this server includes basic console logging for requests and was successfully tested. Key insights from this development include the necessity of restarting Node.js servers to apply code changes, as encountered when debugging the mock server's initial request logger. The current sub-task (3.4) involves creating a comprehensive request/response logging system, which should integrate with src/ApiClient.js to capture all API communication details (requests, responses, failures, metadata including headers, payloads, status codes, timestamps) and log them to the SQLite logs table via src/DBManager.js, supporting configurable verbosity levels potentially tied to currentLogLevel. This new logging system can be tested using the recently developed mock API server to generate traffic. Remember the overall project context regarding Windows service permissions for the SQLite database (Database/database.sqlite) and the established pattern of leveraging existing components like src/DBManager.js and src/ApiClient.js for consistency and efficiency, and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes"
