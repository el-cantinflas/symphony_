Self-improving final prompt: `Begin development of the assigned sub-task as detailed in [`tasks/tasks.json`](tasks/tasks.json:0). During previous work on this project, a critical issue involving a `better-sqlite3` native module compilation error for Electron was resolved; this was addressed by implementing a specific `postinstall` script in [`package.json`](package.json:10): `\"electron-rebuild -v $(node -p \\\"require('electron/package.json').version\\\") -f -w better-sqlite3\"`. Future agents encountering native module compilation or loading errors should first verify this `postinstall` script's integrity and successful execution during `npm install`. For context, previous database schema verifications (if applicable to your current task) were done by temporarily modifying relevant source files (e.g., [`src/DBManager.js`](src/DBManager.js:0), [`src/index.js`](src/index.js:0)) to run and log `PRAGMA table_info` queries, with those temporary changes subsequently reverted. After completing your assigned sub-task's objectives, ensure all relevant project files (including any necessary changes to [`package.json`](package.json:0) or other configuration files) are correctly tracked by git. For the completion of *this current* set of instructions, do *not* update the main [`tasks/tasks.json`](tasks/tasks.json:0) file to mark the sub-task as complete (this will be handled separately or by a different process). For the next agent working on this project, please review the steps taken and context provided (particularly the `better-sqlite3` resolution and the `postinstall` script), and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes.`

Self-improvement final prompt: "Begin development of the assigned sub-task as detailed in tasks/tasks.json. During previous work on this project (specifically sub-task 2.1: "Windows Service Framework Selection and Setup"), node-windows was selected and installed as the Windows service framework, and integrated into src/service.js with basic service event handlers and command-line flags for installation/uninstallation; corresponding npm scripts (service:install, service:uninstall, service:start, service:stop, service:restart) were added to package.json for lifecycle management. A critical issue involving a better-sqlite3 native module compilation error for Electron was previously resolved by implementing a specific postinstall script in package.json: \"electron-rebuild -v $(node -p \\\"require('electron/package.json').version\\\") -f -w better-sqlite3\"; future agents encountering native module compilation or loading errors, particularly when the service interacts with better-sqlite3, should first verify this postinstall script's integrity and consider if similar rebuild steps are necessary for the service's Node.js environment, which might differ from Electron's. Also, be mindful that the Windows service will run under a specific user account, which could affect permissions for accessing the SQLite database located at Database/database.sqlite, and that logging for very early service lifecycle events (e.g., initial installation before the database is confirmed ready) might require alternative strategies if the primary SQLite logging fails. For context, previous database schema verifications were done by temporarily modifying relevant source files to run and log PRAGMA table_info queries, with those temporary changes subsequently reverted.

Self-improvement final prompt: "Begin development of the assigned sub-task as detailed in [`tasks/tasks.json`](tasks/tasks.json:1) and detailed in [`tasks/task_002.txt`](tasks/task_002.txt:0). During previous work on this project (specifically sub-task 2.1: "Windows Service Framework Selection and Setup"), `node-windows` was selected and installed as the Windows service framework, and integrated into [`src/service.js`](src/service.js:1) with basic service event handlers and command-line flags for installation/uninstallation; corresponding npm scripts (`service:install`, `service:uninstall`, `service:start`, `service:stop`, `service:restart`) were added to [`package.json`](package.json:1) for lifecycle management. A critical issue involving a `better-sqlite3` native module compilation error for Electron was previously resolved by implementing a specific `postinstall` script in [`package.json`](package.json:1): `"electron-rebuild -v $(node -p \\"require('electron/package.json').version\\") -f -w better-sqlite3"`; future agents encountering native module compilation or loading errors, particularly when the service interacts with `better-sqlite3`, should first verify this `postinstall` script's integrity and consider if similar rebuild steps are necessary for the service's Node.js environment, which might differ from Electron's. Also, be mindful that the Windows service will run under a specific user account, which could affect permissions for accessing the SQLite database located at [`Database/database.sqlite`](Database/database.sqlite:0), and that logging for very early service lifecycle events (e.g., initial installation before the database is confirmed ready) might require alternative strategies if the primary SQLite logging fails, as was addressed in sub-task 2.2 by adding a `try-catch` around the initial `service_init_started` log event in [`src/service.js`](src/service.js:51) and ensuring the database connection is checked before closing in `stopService`. During the implementation of sub-task 2.2, [`src/service.js`](src/service.js:1) was further enhanced with detailed comments on `node-windows` lifecycle management, clarifying that `start` and `stop` are handled via script execution and termination signals (SIGTERM/SIGINT) respectively, and that `node-windows` does not provide direct `pause`/`continue` handlers, necessitating application-level solutions if such behavior is required; console logs were also added for clearer operational tracing in `initService` and `stopService`. It's also important to remember that any asynchronous operations (like `setInterval`) started during service initialization should be properly cleaned up or managed during the stop sequence to ensure a graceful shutdown, although the current heartbeat interval terminates with the process. Previous database schema verifications were done by temporarily modifying relevant source files to run and log `PRAGMA table_info` queries, with those temporary changes subsequently reverted. After completing your assigned sub-task's objectives, ensure all relevant project files are correctly tracked by git, but do not update the main [`tasks/tasks.json`](tasks/tasks.json:1) file to mark the sub-task as complete.

Recently, for sub-task 2.3, database logging was centralized by adding an addLogEntry function and exporting the db instance in src/DBManager.js, and src/service.js was refactored to use this, including for node-windows event handlers and heartbeat. The heartbeat's setInterval is now correctly cleared during stopService.

For the current sub-task 2.4 (Heartbeat Implementation), the heartbeat interval has been made configurable via the SQLite `config` table (key: `heartbeatIntervalMs`, default: 60000ms) by adding `getConfigValue` and `setConfigValue` functions to [`src/DBManager.js`](src/DBManager.js:1), and a basic health check was added to the `heartbeat` function in [`src/service.js`](src/service.js:1) to verify if the database connection is open, logging a 'degraded' status and 'health_check_fail' event if not, with heartbeat logs now including `status` and `healthDetails`. More advanced recovery mechanisms for missed heartbeats were noted as potential future work.

During previous work on this project, node-windows was integrated into src/service.js for service lifecycle management, and a critical better-sqlite3 native module compilation error for Electron was resolved via a postinstall script in package.json. Database logging was centralized in sub-task 2.3 with an addLogEntry function and exported db instance in src/DBManager.js, which src/service.js was refactored to use, including for node-windows event handlers and a heartbeat mechanism whose interval was made configurable via the SQLite config table (key: heartbeatIntervalMs) in sub-task 2.4, with basic health checks added to the heartbeat function. For the current sub-task (2.5 - Extensive Logging), hierarchical logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL via LOG_LEVELS) has now been implemented by modifying the logs table schema in src/DBManager.js to include a level column (with an ALTER TABLE attempt for existing DBs) and updating the addLogEntry function to accept a log level and filter entries based on a currentLogLevel configurable in the database (defaulting to 'INFO'); all addLogEntry calls in src/service.js have been updated accordingly. Be mindful of Windows service user account permissions for the SQLite database at Database/database.sqlite, that early service lifecycle logging might need fallbacks (though a try-catch exists), and that node-windows handles start/stop via script execution and termination signals, requiring application-level solutions for pause/continue and ensuring asynchronous operations like setInterval are cleaned up on stop. The LOG_LEVELS constant and currentLogLevel config key are now central to logging behavior, and the schema update in DBManager.js uses a simple ALTER TABLE approach. Future work on this sub-task includes advanced log filtering, formatting, performance metrics collection, and an evaluation framework, and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes."

Key considerations moving forward include Windows service user account permissions for the SQLite database at Database/database.sqlite, the potential need for fallbacks for early service lifecycle logging (though a try-catch exists in src/service.js), the fact that node-windows handles start/stop via script execution and termination signals (requiring application-level solutions for pause/continue and ensuring asynchronous operations like setInterval are cleaned up on stop), the centrality of the LOG_LEVELS constant and currentLogLevel config key to logging behavior, and that the schema update in DBManager.js for logging levels used a simple ALTER TABLE approach. The completion of the documentation task (2.6) highlighted the importance of precise task definitions in tasks/tasks.json to prevent ambiguity and confirmed the value of detailed contextual information in prompts for efficient task execution. With this context, proceed with the current sub-task, and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes."

More recently, for sub-task 3.1, an HTTP client was set up in src/ApiClient.js using axios and axios-retry, featuring exponential backoff (specifically, retryCount * 1000ms), retry conditions for network/5xx errors, and integration with addLogEntry from src/DBManager.js for logging retry attempts (WARNING) and final failures (ERROR), with a hardcoded default timeout of 10 seconds. Key considerations moving forward include Windows service user account permissions for the SQLite database at Database/database.sqlite, the potential need for fallbacks for early service lifecycle logging, ensuring robust cleanup of asynchronous operations like setInterval on service stop, the centrality of LOG_LEVELS and currentLogLevel to logging behavior, and the simple ALTER TABLE approach used for schema updates in DBManager.js. The successful, well-scoped completion of sub-task 3.1 by first checking dependencies in package.json, installing them if necessary, and then creating the new module (src/ApiClient.js) with integrated logging using existing functionalities from src/DBManager.js reinforces the effectiveness of clear, iterative steps and leveraging established project components. With this context, proceed with sub-task 3.2, and suggest any further improvements to this prompt or the development process to enhance clarity, prevent recurring issues, and ensure smooth knowledge transfer, including this same request for self-improvement and knowledge sharing in your own completion notes."
