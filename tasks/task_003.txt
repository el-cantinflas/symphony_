# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop API Communication and Config Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add API request module to Node.js service with retry and timeout logic. Implement config reader and validator from SQLite. Prepare mock payloads and test endpoints.
# Details:
Use axios (latest, e.g., 1.x) for HTTP requests. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (e.g., using axios-retry). Add config reader/validator to read from SQLite config table. Prepare mock payloads for Orderwise API and external webhook. Define two test endpoints. Log all request, response, and failure metadata to SQLite logs table.

# Test Strategy:
Test successful and failed API calls. Validate config reading and validation. Check log entries for request metadata and error handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. HTTP Client Setup with Axios and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement an HTTP client using Axios, including robust retry logic with exponential backoff to handle network failures and timeouts.
### Details:
Set up Axios as the HTTP client. Integrate retry logic that handles transient errors and network issues, using exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server. Ensure error handling provides meaningful messages and status codes.

## 2. Configuration Management with SQLite Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a configuration management system that stores and retrieves API settings using SQLite as the backend.
### Details:
Design a schema for storing API configuration parameters (e.g., endpoints, credentials, retry settings) in SQLite. Implement CRUD operations for managing configurations and ensure secure handling of sensitive data.

## 3. Mock Endpoint and Payload Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create mock API endpoints and payloads to simulate real API interactions for testing and development purposes.
### Details:
Implement mock endpoints that mimic expected API behavior and responses. Generate sample payloads for both requests and responses to facilitate integration testing and development without relying on external services.

## 4. Comprehensive Request/Response Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Build a logging system that captures detailed request and response data for all API communications, supporting extensive verbose logs.
### Details:
Log all HTTP requests and responses, including headers, payloads, status codes, and timestamps. Ensure logs are structured, searchable, and can be filtered for debugging and auditing. Support configurable verbosity levels.

## 5. Create and Run Evals, Verify Software Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop and execute evaluation scripts to test the API communication module, leveraging verbose logs to verify correct operation and handle edge cases.
### Details:
Write automated tests and evaluation scripts that exercise all major code paths, including error and retry scenarios. Analyze verbose logs to confirm correct behavior, identify issues, and ensure the module meets requirements.
