# Task ID: 5
# Title: Package and Deploy with MSI Installer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create MSI installer for easy deployment and uninstallation. Configure firewall rules and test deployment on clean Windows environment.
# Details:
Use WiX Toolset (latest, e.g., 4.x) or Advanced Installer to bundle Node.js service, Electron app, and SQLite DB. Configure installer to set up firewall rules for required ports. Ensure installer can run without admin permissions if possible. Document installation and uninstallation flow. Test on clean Windows environment. Ensure uninstall removes all registry and filesystem artifacts.

# Test Strategy:
Test full install/uninstall cycle without admin permissions. Verify firewall rule presence. Check for leftover files or registry entries after uninstall.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Select and set up installer tool [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Research, select, and install an appropriate MSI packaging tool such as MSI Wrapper or Advanced Installer based on project requirements.
### Details:
Download and install the chosen tool, set up necessary licenses, and ensure compatibility with the Windows environment. Consider factors like cost, features, and ease of use when selecting the tool.

## 2. Configure application bundling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the MSI package by bundling the application files, dependencies, and configuration settings.
### Details:
Select the executable file, generate a GUID for the MSI application, configure installation paths, define registry entries, and set up any required environment variables. Ensure all necessary files are included in the package.

## 3. Implement firewall rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Configure and test firewall rules that will be deployed with the application package.
### Details:
Identify all network connections required by the application, create appropriate inbound and outbound firewall rules, and incorporate them into the MSI package. Test the rules to ensure they allow necessary communication while maintaining security.

## 4. Test installation and uninstallation flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Verify the complete installation and uninstallation processes on clean test environments.
### Details:
Create test environments that mirror production settings, perform silent and interactive installations, verify all components are correctly installed, test uninstallation to ensure no artifacts remain, and document any issues encountered during testing.

## 5. Create deployment documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for the deployment process including GPO deployment instructions.
### Details:
Document the steps to create a distribution point, create a Group Policy Object, assign or publish the MSI package, and configure deployment options. Include troubleshooting guides and system requirements in the documentation.

## 6. Create evaluation and verification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Develop testing software and logging mechanisms to verify correct installation and functionality.
### Details:
Implement verbose logging for the installation process, create automated tests to verify application functionality post-installation, develop evaluation criteria for successful deployment, and establish a process for collecting and analyzing deployment metrics.
