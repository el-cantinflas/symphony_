      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Core Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project repository setup into subtasks covering: 1) Node.js/Electron/SQLite installation and configuration, 2) SQLite schema definition and initialization, 3) Project structure and documentation setup, and 4) Version control initialization with git.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Node.js, Electron, SQLite) and requires careful setup of the project foundation. While not extremely complex, it requires attention to detail for proper dependency management, schema design, and documentation. The subtasks naturally divide along technology boundaries."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Node.js Windows Service with SQLite Integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Windows service implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Windows service framework selection and setup, 2) Service lifecycle management, 3) SQLite integration for logging, 4) Heartbeat implementation, and 5) Service installation and configuration documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Running Node.js as a Windows service introduces platform-specific complexity. Integration with SQLite for persistent logging adds another layer of complexity. The service lifecycle management requires careful handling of edge cases. This task has higher complexity due to OS-level integration and potential permission issues."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop API Communication and Config Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the API communication module into subtasks covering: 1) HTTP client setup with axios including retry logic, 2) Configuration management with SQLite integration, 3) Mock endpoint and payload implementation, and 4) Comprehensive request/response logging system.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves network communication with error handling, which introduces complexity. The retry logic with exponential backoff requires careful implementation. Configuration management and comprehensive logging add additional complexity layers. The task requires handling various edge cases like network failures and timeouts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Electron UI for Configuration and Log Monitoring",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Electron UI development into subtasks covering: 1) Electron application scaffolding, 2) Configuration screen UI implementation, 3) Log viewer component development, 4) SQLite integration for config persistence, 5) Test functionality implementation, and 6) UI styling and responsive design.",
      "reasoning": "Building a desktop UI with Electron introduces significant complexity due to the need to manage both frontend and backend processes. The UI requires multiple interactive components, SQLite integration, and responsive design considerations. The communication between UI and background processes adds another layer of complexity."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Package and Deploy with MSI Installer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the packaging and deployment process into subtasks covering: 1) Installer tool selection and setup, 2) Application bundling configuration, 3) Firewall rule implementation, 4) Installation/uninstallation flow testing, and 5) Deployment documentation creation.",
      "reasoning": "Creating an MSI installer involves working with specialized tools and handling Windows-specific deployment concerns. Configuring firewall rules and ensuring clean installation/uninstallation adds complexity. Testing on clean environments and handling permissions correctly requires careful attention to detail. The deployment process must be robust to avoid issues in production environments."
